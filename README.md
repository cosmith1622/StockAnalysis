###Description###
The project is designed to determine based on a set of criteria the best stocks to buy for a given day.  
The project uses a decision tree to classify if a trade will finish positive or negative.  
The classifer looks 20 trading days into the future, with a three day window to determine if the 
stock will close above the purchase price.

###Files###
The project has two important python files the StockFunctions and StockAnalysis files.  
The AnalysisFunctions and AnomalyDectection were incorrectly attached to the project.
The StockFunctions.py files are various functions used to rangle and model data for the project.
The StockAnalysis.py file is the startup file used to run the script to evaulate the data.
